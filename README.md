# ButtBoss
 A True Delight

The kind of Malware you can live with. 

Changes all your photos to butts, your desktop icons to butts, and any shortcuts will open to photos of butts. It will uninstall itself after 15 minutes, but will create a persistence mechanism that will have it run a scheduled task and reinstall every X days.
