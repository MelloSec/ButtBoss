# ButtBoss
## The Kind of Malware you can live with. 



### Backs up and replaces everything on your desktop with random shots of butts. It will uninstall itself within 24 hours, but has a persistence mechanism that will schedule its re-install every X days between 7-25. Left that section commented out... because your buttboss is nothing but responsible.
